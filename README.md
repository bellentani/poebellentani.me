# My Portfolio

Hy, that's my portfolio. I made this website to show my Design and Code skills. 2 days to design, 2 days to test with real people and more 4 days coding (1st day getting up de enviroment) - up to 8 days to end all process.

I'll work a lot more on this site, is my playground and sandbox now. :D

## The Process

The design was made on Adobe XD. After the first mockup I tested with some people and get feedback from usability issues. With a list of issues I started the programing, fixing the problems identified directly at the code. 

Focusing on mobile and performance, I made some improvements on the page structures and change the contend flow. The structure for the portfolio are 2 pages, a COVER and a INTERNAL. Internal pages are templates with modifiers and controllers made on Javascript. 


## More Info

This site use: 

* Node.js to serve statics pages
* Digital Ocean instance
* A lot of domain redirects and security setup (SSL keys and some Nginx configurations)
* Gulp.js to render static pages

This site WILL use: 

* Node.js serving a Express aplications with Handlebars
* Firebase to add a dynamic layer (the content will be update by a little CMS)
* Angular and React in some pages to show my expertise

Some itens at my roadmap: 

* Acessibility issues: targeting get a 100% acessibility using WAI and ARIA recomendations;
* Put more content on my portfolio
* Setup a dynamic contact form at home (index.html) to avoid the necessity to open the client to send a email to me
